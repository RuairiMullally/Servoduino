# Servoduino

### 'Servoduino' is a piece of Arduino code that was used in our BT Young Scientist & Technology Exhibition project, title 'Can You See Me Now?'. In this project we developed an aid for helping visually imparied people to learn, read, and practice braille.

FINALBRAILLE is the completed software. 
All other files are either earlier versions of a piece of a software, or stored there to allow editing between the two of us.

If you do wish to use this for anything, note we have used an Arduino Uno and HiTEC HS-311 servo motors.
